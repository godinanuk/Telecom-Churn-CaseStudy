Machine learning models for telecom churn

This program will give you a glimpse of different algorithms / models, we can use for classification problem. Please note that we might see more algorithms which I haven't used or covered.  I have tried many or most of them but only included the ones which had earned their position for the dataset I have used.

Note: As the dataset file is larger than allowed sizes, I could not add full dataset.  I have uploaded a shorter version.
